## Style Guidelines:

- A warm saffron (#FF9933) to represent the vibrancy and energy of India. This color will be used for primary buttons, active states, and key interactive elements.
- A very light, desaturated yellow (#FAF7F0), derived from the primary hue, that provides a warm and inviting feel without being too harsh. It offers a gentle backdrop for content.
- A deep orange (#D46A00), an analogous color to saffron, providing contrast and depth for secondary actions and visual accents.
- 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that will ensure the interface appears friendly to the target demographic of the Indian community
- 'Space Grotesk', a futuristic-feeling sans-serif to bring freshness
- Use a consistent set of modern, line-based icons to represent different categories, actions, and entities across the platform. Ensure icons are intuitive and culturally relevant.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout across all pages, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment. Use cards to present content in a visually appealing and organized manner.
